# Arduino-Digital-Clock-DS1302
Arduino RTC Library is the library which we have to include in the code by going to:
Sketch < include Library < Add.ZIP File < add This file

Set the time by going into void setup() Section
there we see a myTime line of code just set the time, data parameters
and upload it after uploading comment that line of cofe(use double slash ie //) 
because once the time is set it remains unchanged.
